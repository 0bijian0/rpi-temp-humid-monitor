## TO DO LIST

 - Update the updateMysql.py script to include some error handling code. It probably crashes out if the MySQL operation fails. Better to handle this rather than have it simply crash.a

 - Update the daemon script so that the python script is daemonised.
 
 - Possibly update the python script to become a daemon itself, e.g. using python-daemon module.
