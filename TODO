## TO DO LIST

 - Update the updateMysql.py script to calculate the time taken to run, so that the next run of sensorRead is run at 60 seconds MINUS the updateMysql run time.

 - Update the updateMySQL.py script to log details to the log file.
 
 - Update the daemon script so that the python script is daemonised.
 
 - Possibly update the python script to become a daemon itself, e.g. using python-daemon module.
